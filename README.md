**Takagi Kaito**, *a low status high schooler*, ~~your typical mob character so to say~~, ***was just a normal everyday*** **explorer who _hunted_ slimes every day** <sub>in the dungeons that appeared in Japan, earning pocket money while admiring his childhood friend, the class queen, from afar.</sub>

<sup>One day, a golden slime he had <b>never seen appears before him</b>. After he defeats it, he obtains an extremely rare item worth hundreds of millions as a drop, a servant card that can summon mythical beings!! After he makes up his mind and summons it, a warrior maiden with unparalleled beauty appears.</sup>
